# Usable Security: Week 1

## HCI

Is the study of how people interact with technology.

### People

- Understand both the psychological and cognitive abilities of users
- Build technology that takes advantage of people's inherent abilities
- Avoid over taxing people by requiring them to do things that they're not cognitively capable of, or that are difficult

### Technology

- Speaks to both design and evaluation of technology
- Use knowledge about people, the tasks, and the way they're interacting with systems to design technology
- Evaluate how well that technology works to make sure we've done it right

## Usability

| Measure               | Description                                                       | How to measure?                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Speed**             | how quickly can tha task be accomplished                          | timing                                                      |
| **Efficiency**        | how many mistakes are made in accomplishing the task              | couting errors                                              |
| **Learnability**      | how easy is to learn to use the system                            | how long it takes to user to learn                          |
| **Memorability**      | once learned, how easy is to remember how to use the system       | how long it takes to user to do the same task over and over |
| **User Preference**   | what do users like?                                               | questionnaires, interviews, etc                             |

## Tasks

Tasks are goals users set out to accomplish in a system.

### Common errors in task creation

- Leading or too descriptive
- Asking specific questions
- Directing users toward things you want to tell them, not what they want to know

## Chunking information

- Working memory
- Transform random characters into something easier to memorize

## Mental models

### Affordances

Things within a system that show a user how they're supposed to be used.

- Mapping: how certain functionalities will map to something that you see
- Visibility: the most visible thing is the task
- Feedback: give feedback

### Constraints

Talk about how a system can prevent us from doing things that we shouldn't and how the design of it can encourage us to do things the right way.

### Conventions

Describe a common understanding of what something means. These can be cultural or relatively universal.
